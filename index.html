                <h3>I am passionate about the web.</h3>
                <p>Hi there! I'm Renny and I'm a front-end developer living in the PNW, Washington specifically, with my husband, two-kids and my
                    in-laws. In my previous life, I've been a library Jill-of-all-trades, as accounts payable clerk, a payroll analyst, a POD 
                    entrepreneur and a belly dancer. My journey into tech started with a pandemic. I'm sure I am not alone in this, but having 
                    been a stay-at-home mom for the previous 4 years, I knew it was time to start something new. I've been following Skillcrush 
                    for years, and the downtime I have due to the now-infamous virus has given me the time I need to focus on it. I was 
                    immediately hooked afer going through their free coding bootcamp and wanted to learn all the things immediately. That 
                    curiosity has opened a door that I'm certain will never be shut. Learning how to build my first website, I've realized I have
                    found something that gives me freedom & versatility I've been looking for in my work and home life. Now I've made a full 
                    switch to front-end development, where I can use my organizational skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.<br>
                    <br>
                    I can't wait to see what we can build together!</p>
